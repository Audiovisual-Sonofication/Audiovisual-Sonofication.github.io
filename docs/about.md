# About the Project

## Project Overview

**AudioVisual Application for Interactive Medical Data Exploration** is an innovative tool designed to enhance the interpretation of medical imaging through audiovisual sonification. Developed as an Imfusion Plugin in C++, this tool integrates advanced computational techniques with artistic expression to transform medical image data into audio and physical models. By sending OSC messages to Processing, the plugin facilitates the creation of sound-emitting physical models, enabling a multisensory approach to medical diagnostics and research.

The project aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a novel method to perceive and interact with medical data, thereby enhancing understanding and potentially uncovering new insights into complex medical images.
